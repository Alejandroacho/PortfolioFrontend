# Welcome to the UI guideline used in this project

Here you will find the components and the design patterns used in this project.
It was built using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
Atomic design was used to organize the components, so you can find the components in the following folders:
- Atoms
- Molecules
- Organisms

## How to use
You can go through the components using the sidebar on the left.
You can also use the search bar to find a specific component.
Inside each component you will find the code used to build it,
and a playground where you can change the props and see the component changing.
Also, each component has a description of what it is and how to use it.
You will find different use cases in the component folder, so you can see how to use it in different situations.
For example, in the button component folder you will find this scenarios:
- Primary button
- Secondary button
- Text button
- Magic button

Finally, you will find a section called "Colors", where you will find the color,
the name and the hex code along with the css class of each color used in this project.
